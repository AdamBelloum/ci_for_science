Continuous Integration for Scientific Applications
################################################################################
üë©‚ÄçüöÄ This repository contains a brief example of Continuous integration for scientific applications,
using miniconda_ and Python3.

Overview
********
`Continuous Integration`_ (**CI**)  **CI** helps to automate the testing and delivery of scientific software tools. A **CI** is just a workflow that runs automatically as a result of a certain action
taken in the source code (e.g. a push, pull-request, etc.).

_`Continuous Integration`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration

In this repository there are stored 3 different configuration files for *Github Actions*, *Travis* and *Gitlab CI.*. These configuration files encodes the actions to perform with the code on a given
architecture, like installing the library from scratch in a Ubuntu machine.

GitHub actions
**************
The *Github actions* configuration can be found at `Python actions file <.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml>`_. There is comprehensive documentation of what are `Github actions`_ and how to use them.

Travis CI
*********
The `Travis configuration file <.travis.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using the *Travis*. See `Travis tutorial`_.

Gitlab CI
*********
The `GitlabCI configuration file <.gitlab-ci.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using the *Gitlab CI*. A comprehensive documentation is available for the `GitLab CI`_ tool.

Azure pipelines
***************
If you want to uze the `Azure pipelines`_ Have a look at `Tania Allard great tutorial`_.
