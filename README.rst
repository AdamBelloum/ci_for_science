üë©‚ÄçüöÄ üì° üî¨ Continuous Integration for Scientific Applications
################################################################################
This repository contains a brief example of Continuous integration for scientific applications,
using miniconda_ and Python3.

Overview
********
`Continuous Integration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ (**CI**) helps to automate the testing and delivery of scientific software tools. A **CI** is just a workflow that runs automatically ü§ñ as a result of a certain action
taken in the source code (e.g. a push, pull-request, etc.).

In this repository there are stored 3 different configuration files for *Github Actions*, *Travis* and *Gitlab CI.*. These configuration files encodes the actions to perform with the code on a given
architecture, like installing the library from scratch in a Ubuntu machine.

###########################
üõ†Ô∏è Setting up a CI workflow
###########################

|octocat| GitHub actions
************************
The *Github actions* configuration can be found at `Python actions file <.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml>`_. There is comprehensive documentation of what are `Github actions`_ and how to use them.

|Travis| Travis CI
******************
The `Travis configuration file <.travis.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using the *Travis*. See `Travis tutorial`_.

|gitlab| GitLab CI
*********
The `GitLabCI configuration file <.gitlab-ci.yml>`_ contains the configuration to call a **CI** workflow using the *Gitlab CI*. A comprehensive documentation is available for the `GitLab CI`_ tool.

Azure pipelines
***************
If you want to use the `Azure pipelines <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/>`_ Have a look at `Tania Allard's great tutorial <https://github.com/trallard/ci-research>`_.

##################################
üöÄ Running on your own infrascture
##################################
Sometimes you want to have more control over the hardware infrascture, compilers, etc. when performing
continuous integration. *GitHub Actions* and *GitLab CI/CD* allow you to set up your infrascture,
the following links contains a guide to help you to run a **CI** workflow on your own infrascture:

- `GitLab CI/CD self-hosted runner <https://github.com/NLESC-JCER/gitlab_runner>`_
- `GitHub Actions self-hosted runnner <https://github.com/NLESC-JCER/linux_actions_runner>`_


###############################
ü¶Ñ Running the package examples
###############################
This package contains a toy example to estimate the value of œÄ using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).
To run the Monte Carlo calculator, you will need to

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. install cython: ```pip install cython```
3. install the library from the root folder:``` pip install -e .```
4. run the command line interface like:
    ```
    run_simulation -n 1000
    ```
The previous command will estimate œÄ using a 1000 points.
